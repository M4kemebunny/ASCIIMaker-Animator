# ASCIIMaker-Animator
Here's the little ASCII animating pack i made that's easy to use!
# What modules you need for it to run?
  It uses ascii_magic and replit so you need to first install that modules from pip
  Install:
  
    pip install ascii_magic
    
    pip install replit
# How to use it?
  1-First you need to extract frames by using a cmd line tool like [Ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  
  2-You need to Extract them to the Frames folder that's in the ASCIIMaker's folder
  
  3-Run the program using IDLE
  
  Note:it didn't work me in cmd so I use Idle that came with python
  After the program finished:
  4-Export your ASCII frames from ASCIItxt folder to the txtASCIIs folder that's in the ASCIIAnimator's folder
  5-Run the program
  6-Name your animation to whatever you want
  7-Type which fps do you want your animation(Only type number or it will throw error)
  8-When it finished you will have your **Animname**.py at the ExportedAnim folder
    
I hope this is a fun tool!
